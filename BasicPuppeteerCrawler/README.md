## puppeteer

```bash
   $ npm i puppeteer
```

Note: When you install Puppeteer, it downloads a recent version of Chromium (~170Mb Mac, ~282Mb Linux, ~280Mb Win) that is guaranteed to work with the API.

## puppeteer-core

Since version 1.7.0 we publish the puppeteer-core package, a version of Puppeteer that doesn't download Chromium by default.

```bash
   $ npm i puppeteer-core
```
